# Real-Time-Human-Behavior-detection-around-Birds
Modules that are included in the project are: Bird Detection, Age &amp; Gender Detection, Facial Expression Detection. Bird Detection will include detecting birds in the frame and recognizing the species of the bird. Age and Gender Detection module includes detecting a face and cropping out that portion, then based on that divide into Age groups and detecting the age of a person and his/her Gender. The Facial Expression detection module will include detection of a face in the image and cropping out that portion, then recognizing the facial expression/ emotion of an individual. These 3 modules working together will give an output which will tell us which category of people will react to which species of birds and in what manner. This project is aimed to create a report by collecting data and building a dataset for people who are working in the Research field of Birds
